# Inclimify

Embedded part of IoT web app gathering temperature and humidity data from sensors I made during my internship.

## How does it work?

Sensor gathers needed data, then sends it to a SQL server so you can track how it changes over time.

## What do you need?
- ESP8266 module with a battery shield
- DHT11/DHT22 humidity sensor
- SQL server for gathering temperature data
